PingMonitor - Internet connectivity notification
Colin King <cking@m202.net>

For several months, my cable modem would completely freeze about every 4 hours.
The cable company could not seem to fix the problem, even though they were at
least able to admit that there was a detectable problem. Replacing the modem
didn't help. Eventually, the problem "resolved itself" and my Internet
connection was stable, but during this time it was very annoying and was one of
the reasons to move my e-mail hosting away from home and to a VPS.

This program constantly pings a remote address. I had 5 static IPs and was
using it to ping my ISP's gateway, which would be unreachable when the modem
was frozen. This program would flash the error LED on my Soekris Net5501 every
time the gateway failed to respond.

This program compiles under FreeBSD and Linux, but has only been tested under
FreeBSD. It uses /dev/error/led, which requires the CPU_SOEKRIS kernel option.

I was too lazy to implement command line options, even though it would take less
time than it did to write this README, so for now everything is hardcoded.
Good luck.
